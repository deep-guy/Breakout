This is a 2 Dimensional Video Game made in Python (Using Pygame).

About:
This is a video game where there is a user-controlled BAR which the user
can use to reflect a ball.
The ball is an object with which the player is going to break bricks,
which have been scattered across the level. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Win Condition: 
When all the bricks on the screen have been 'broken'

Loss Condition: 
When you lose all your lives. Lives are lost when the
player fails to reflect the ball and the ball falls through the screen.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions to load the game:
Please run the file GAME.py as a python source code, with all the
accompanying files in the same directory.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Features of the game:
1.Two different LEVELS (1 & 2)
2.Two different MODES (Normal & Warp)
3.Three different DIFFICULTY MODES (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD)
4.Powerups:
  a)Ice Brick: Slows down the ball
  b)Exploding Brick: Explodes upon contact
  c)Cosmic Brick: Increases the speed of the ball
5.Colourful GUI
------------------------------------------------------------------
Controls:
LEFT ARROW-> Move the bar to the left
RIGHT ARROW-> Move the bar to the right
SPACE-> Pause the game
------------------------------------------------------------------
Mechanics: To give the player some control over the ball, we have
implemented a mechanic. When the ball hits to the right of the bar, it
will reflect to the right, regardless of which direction it came from.
Similarly for the left side. 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Tip: The player can control the angle at which the ball is going to reflect by
striking the ball when the BAR itself is in motion. It will
increase/decrease the velocity depending on the direction.
